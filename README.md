Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial component of data science which allows you to develop the gist of what your data look like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them. Ultimately, EDA is important because it allows the investigator to make critical decisions about what is interesting to pursue and what probably isnâ€™t worth following up on and thus building a hypothesis using the relationships between variables.

In this notebook I will use a SampleSuperstore dataset. It contains information about products, sales, profits, and so on that can use to identify key areas for improvement within this fictitious company.

The Dataset can be found here:
